# MMORPG backend sample
Browser MMORPG sample for backend code. Remember: This is not a real game and I do not intent to finish it, so any contributions will be rejected since I'm using this one just for hobby purposes.

## Requirements
- Node v14 or higher;
- NPM v6 or higher.

## Running
Run `npm run dev` to start backend server.

## Known issues
- Exp for killing enemies is a static value sent to front-end client and not saved, not even in memory. Refresh the game and it will be reseted;
- Since back-end development is not a big deal at this moment in my career, I invested almost all my time learning new things (for me, of course) with animations, canvas and sprites, using only a basic event-oriented back-end. This means that I left lots of `TODO` with code design improvements or features that were not made.
