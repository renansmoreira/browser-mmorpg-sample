# MMORPG sample
Sample code of a browser MMORPG. This is not a real game and I do not intent to finish it, so any contributions will be rejected since I'm using this one just for hobby purposes.

## Purpose
As I said before, I made this project for hobby, looking to know how things in games works, improving my skills in:
- HTML canvas drawing;
- Sprites;
- Positioning and camera effects;
- Real-time multiplayer using something that is not UDP;
- Event-driven architecture in both sides.

## Features, running instructions and technologies
Check `client` and `backend` README files.
